 Thanks for using HandyUnicode! (ver 1.0)
 
 If characters don't render properly, make sure your terminal is set up for utf8, and has a complete font for unicode

 Commands:
  • ":search": Stars a new query
      Not case sensitive, and words can be out of order
      You will get a page of up to 8 results numbered. You can press enter to see the next page
      Results are sorted by use count
      You can use "my words" to have a strict order
      You can use -words to remove search results that satisfy this search term;
  • Enter: See the next page of the current query if there is one
      If you reach "no more results", you can just press again to redo the query;
  • 1-8 (a digit): Select a character among the last results
      The character will be copied to clipboard if it can, and its use count will be incremented;
  • q..: Quit the program;
  • h..: Show this menu!

  First startup:
      The program will load the 'allkeys.txt' file (created by the unicode organization) and create the database
      If that process was interrupted, an incomplete db will exist. You need to delete it (codes.db) and restart
